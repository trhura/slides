# Low Level <small>Vs</small> High Level

+ **Low Level Programming Language**
  + Little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture.
  + Either machine code or assembly language, sometime C

+ **High Level Programming Language**
  + Strong abstraction from the details of the computer.
  + The amount of abstraction provided defines how "high-level" a programming language is.

# Language Generation
</br>
+ **1GL** — <small>machine language</small>

+ **2GL** — <small>assembly language</small>

+ **3GL** — <small>supports structured programming, C, C++, C#, Java</small>

+ **4GL** — <small>domain-specific languages (reports, databases), blurred distinction with 3GL as they also support 4GL abilities</small>

+ **5GL** — <small> solving problems using constraints given to the program, rather than using an algorithm written by a programmer. Constraint-based and logic programming languages and declarative languages. </small>

# Compiled <small>Vs</small> Interpreted

+ **Compiled Language**
 + compiled source code to native code or bytecode <small>(intermediate form)</small> at compile time.
 + Machine-friendldy, more efficient
 + Execution speed <small>Vs</small> Cross-platform compatibility. (compilation targets)

+ **Interpreted Language**
  + execute instructions directly, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions at run time.
  + slower but easier to develop (scripting, prototyping)

# Static <small>Vs</small> Dynamic Typing

+ ** Static Typing **
 + Type information is known at compile time.

+ ** Dynamic Typing **
 +
